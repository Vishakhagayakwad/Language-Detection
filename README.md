# Language Identification using NLP

🎉 *Welcome to the Language Identification Project!* 🚀

This project aims to identify languages from text data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Our dataset includes text in various languages such as Estonian, Tamil, French, Spanish, and Chinese.

## 📋 Project Overview

The project encompasses the following key steps:

1. *Data Preprocessing*: This involves cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
2. *Model Selection*: Choosing the appropriate algorithms for language identification.
3. *Language Detection*: Implementing models to accurately identify languages.

## 🛠 Steps to Reproduce

### 1. Setup

Begin by importing the necessary libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn components.

### 2. Data Preparation

Read the dataset and separate it into features (text data) and the target variable (language labels).

### 3. Text Vectorization

Transform the text data into numerical feature vectors using a vectorization technique like CountVectorizer.

### 4. Train-Test Split

Divide the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

### 5. Model Training

Train a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier on the training data.

### 6. Model Evaluation

Assess the model's accuracy on the test data to ensure it performs well.

### 7. Model Saving

Save the trained model to a file for later use.

### 8. Deployment

Deploy the model using Streamlit, providing a user interface where text input can be analyzed to predict the language.

## 🌐 Importance of Language Identification

Language identification is crucial in the global landscape for several reasons:

- *Enhanced Communication*: Improves user experience on multilingual platforms.
- *Accessibility and Localization*: Helps in tailoring content to specific languages.
- *Cross-Lingual Applications*: Supports applications that operate across different languages and regions.

In a world that is increasingly connected and multilingual, accurate language identification bridges communication gaps and fosters better global interactions.

Happy coding! 🎉
